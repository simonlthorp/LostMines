# Lost Mines

Lost Mines was created using C++ and SDL.  The game engine uses an entity component system that made it easy to adapt the game to our needs and scale up or down according to our schedule.  Personally, I mainly worked on the code for the animation, the sound and music, and the player mechanics.
